Data Types can be primitive or object

There are 7 types of primitive data types


1.Number -> Floating point numbers
2.String -> Sequence of characters
3.Boolean -> true or false
4.Undefined -> the variable not yet defined
5.Null -> also means empty value
6.Symbol -> Value that is unique and cannot be changed
7.BigInt -> Large Numbers

Java Script Has dynamic typing - We dont need to mention variable data type.Data types determined automatically .

typeof - used to find variable data type

Declaring variables 

var,let,const

1.let - variable may change in future

ex) let n=10;
    n="eded"
    
2.const - variable should not be changed in future - immutable variable - we cant declar empty const variable

3.var - old way of defining variable - same as let 


Template literals 

${}

Type conversion :
Manually convert one type to another type

coercion:
javascript automatically converts type in backend
